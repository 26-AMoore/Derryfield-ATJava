 *Scan in quiz scores from the user until the user enters 'q' to quit
Print the quiz scores in a neat manner for the user to review
Ask the user if they would like to drop the lowest score (type 'y' to do so)
If the user wants to drop the lowest score, use a method to drop the lowest score from the array of doubles and then reprint the scores with the lowest value removed
If there are more than one quiz with the same lowest score, only drop the first instance of the score
Preserve the order of the remaining test scores as you drop the lowest score
